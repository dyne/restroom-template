
# Always use 'Rule caller restroom-mw' when using Restroom
Rule caller restroom-mw


# we'll need to create a keypair to produce an ECDSA signature later
Scenario 'ecdh': Create the keypair
Given that I am known as 'Alice'
Given that I have my 'keypair'
# Those are restroom-mw statements: define the endpoints
Given that I have an endpoint named 'endpoint' 
Given that I have an endpoint named 'timeServer' 

# We need those object to store the output of the endpoints
Given I have a 'string dictionary' named 'dataFromEndpoint'
Given I have a 'number' named 'timestamp'

# Those are restroom-mw statements: connect to endpoints and store their output into Zenroom's objects
Given I connect to 'endpoint' and save the output into 'dataFromEndpoint'
Given I connect to 'timeServer' and save the output into 'timestamp'

# Create a string dictionary to format the output 
When I create the 'string dictionary'
and I rename the 'string dictionary' to 'outputData'

# Organize the output of the endpoints in the string dictionary
When I insert 'dataFromEndpoint' in 'outputData'
When I insert 'timestamp' in 'outputData'

# ECDSA signature
# When I create the keypair
When I create the signature of 'outputData'
When I rename the 'signature' to 'outputData.signature'

# Printing the output
Then print the 'outputData'
Then print the 'outputData.signature'
